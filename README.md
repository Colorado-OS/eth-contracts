# Colorado OS - ETHDenver 2021 - ColoradoJAM 

### What is Colorado OS? 
Colorado OS was built to demonstrate how Web3 could be used to establish a digital backbone for a more usable, efficient, and secure public network infrastructure. Initially we introduce [Grasshopper Digital Signature Interface](https://github.com/Colorado-OS/Grasshopper) as a means of connecting self sovereign DIDs into Web3.

### ETHDenver ColoradoJam 2021 
🦄 We envision Colorado OS starting as an series of decentralized license registries on Web3. We think there is room for more though. 

We think a system like this could reduce complexity, create new connections, and strengthen privacy and security elements of public infrastructure in Colorado.  

🌎 1) First we show how a deFi state parks pass can be issued to a self-sovereign ID with Colorado OS. Thinking about regen finance, we can see an an optional **portion of the parks pass fee be allocated  into an interest bearing DeFi position that generates recurring APY revenue for Colorado Parks.** ⭐ 

🎲 2) Keeping on with regen finance, we see how Colorado OS can mint and issue a **digital gaming license** for players that can be used on blockchain based **not for-profit games of chance**. ⭐ 

### UseCase #1 - DeFi State Parks Pass


### UseCase #2 - Not-for-profit games of chance $$$ --> Public Infrastructure
First Colorado OS issues a Web3 digital gaming license NFT to the player that unlocks a trusted set of Web3 based games. Then, all gaming profits are be pooled into a public goods and infrastructure contract. This set the foundation for things like funds distribution though quadratic voting and self sovereign IDs.  

You can find the contracts and deployment scripts here on the GamingLicense & Token Contract  [GAMING-README.md here](./docs/GAMING-LICENSE.md). 

### How it works 
🦗 Initially, self-sovereign IDs are connected into Colorado OS using [Grasshopper Digital Signature Exchange](https://github.com/Colorado-OS/Grasshopper). Grasshopper is minimalist way to mint digital attestations about an arrangement or exchange. 

Once you've connected a wallet/account into Colorado OS (using Grasshopper or an existing Web3 tool/util) you can begin to interact with other on-chain components of Colorado OS.

**Standard Ethereum wallets and Web3 DID solutions can be used with Grasshopper & Colorado OS :)**  

💡 Grasshopper was bootstrapped from these awesome [Compound.Finance governance examples](https://github.com/compound-developers/compound-governance-examples) for implementing EIP712 signed messages for voting and delegation.💡 

### Beyond ETHDenver
A Colorado OS license registry could be deployed for business, professional, fishing & hunting, and a host of other types of licenses.  Grasshopper aims to be the crypto glue that connects Web3 & self-sovereign ids but is not required to be used with Colorado OS.   

We can also see this working nicely as an entry way to a secure blockchain based tax system and a secure Web3 based public/private GPS network. 

Zero Knowledge proofs & layer 2 connections are on the road map. 

### Other Possible Use Cases For Colorado OS 
### Web3 Business Registry (TODO)
Here we show how Grasshopper and Colorado OS can check ID & deploy a business registry contract to Ethereum that mints and distributes a Signed Digital Business License NFT. 

### Web3 Outdoor (Hunting & Fishing) Licensing (TODO)

### Web3 Professional Licensing (TODO) 

### Web3 State Tax System 

### Web3 public GPS network

### Disclaimer 
This is a proof of concept and is not ready for mainnet. There are security and privacy challenges that have not yet been reviewed and addressed. Both Colorado OS and Grasshopper should be audited by cryptographers. 

The CoinFlip games has been left without a coin withdraw function intentionally. It has also been made simplistically on purpose. We _could_ use ChainLink or an other oracle to generate a seed of entropy and fork the CoinFlip contract to seed provably fair tournament trees. There are a host of other possibilities in this area as well.
