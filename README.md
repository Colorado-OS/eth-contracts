# Colorado OS - ETHDenver 2021 - ColoradoJAM 

### What is Colorado OS? 
Colorado OS was built to demonstrate how Web3 could be used to establish a backbone for a more efficient and secure public infrastructure. At the foundation we introduce the [Grasshopper Digital Signature Interface](https://github.com/Colorado-OS/Grasshopper) as a means connecting users/applicants/humans into Colorado OS. 

### ETHDenver ColoradoJam 2021 
1) ðŸ¦„ First we show how Colorado OS could operate a decentralized business registry on Ethereum using digital signatures and self sovereign identities. 

2) ðŸŽ² Then we see how Colorado OS can mint and issue a digital gaming license that players can use to unlock and play blockchain based not-for-profit games of chance. 

**Maybe we should start with State Park Pass or Hunting/Fishing License because they have bounties?**

### Example # 1 - Web3 Business Registry 
Here we show how Colorado OS can deploy a business registry contract to Ethereum that mints and distributes a Signed Digital Business License NFT.

### Example # 2 - Not-for-profit games of chance $$$> Public Infrastructure  
In the example, we expand on the digital licensing concept and establish a gaming license registry that will issue players a signed digital gaming License NFT. Players can use this gaming license token to interact with decentralized, not-for-profit games of chance.  All gaming profits are pulled into a public goods and infrastructure pool. 

You can find details about the [GamingLicenseRegistry.sol & GamingLicenseToken.sol contracts here](./docs/GAMING-LICENSE.md). 

### How it works 
Initially, humans are introduced into Colorado OS using self-sovereign identities and the [Grasshopper Digital Signature Interface](https://github.com/Colorado-OS/Grasshopper). Grasshopper is minimalist way to mint digital attestations about an arrangement or exchange. Grasshopper was bootstrapped in part from [Compound Finance's awesome examples](https://github.com/compound-developers/compound-governance-examples) for implementing EIP712 signed messages for voting and delegation. 

Once you've connected a wallet/account into Colorado OS (using Grasshopper or an existing Web3 tool/util) you can begin to interact with other on-chain components of Colorado OS. 

### Whats next? 
We can see a place where the Colorado OS model can be extended to state parks passe, hunting, fishing, professional, and a host of other licenses. We can also see this working nicely as an entry way to a secure blockchain based tax system. 

If we expand out further, we see a foundation for other compelling use cases like secure public GPS as well. 

### Disclaimer 
This is an exploratory step at moving state operations to Web3. It's a proof of concept that contains security and privacy challenges that have not yet been addresses.
