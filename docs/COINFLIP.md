# CoinFlip.sol 
[CoinFlip Contract](../contracts/CoinFlip.sol) 

This is a simple quick coin flip game contract built to demo Colorado OS & Grasshopper digital gaming license concepts. 

This POC contract should _NOT_ be used on mainnet. One reason for that is that we've used a sudo random generator. There are are other reasons too. Some of those reason are not related to the technology. 

CoinFlip.sol was developed as one piece of a larger poof of concept. Many details and features of a good game have been intentionally left out. Not-for-profit games of chance feeding public goods pools is a knotty concept. 

ðŸ’Ž We can see a fork of CoinFlip.sol that incorporates ChainLink provably fair random seed distributions. These seeds could be used for off-chain provably fair tournament trees on web2 ðŸ’Ž
